.SH NAME
import_to_blender -- invoke
.UR https://blender.org/
Blender
.UE
importer addons in batch mode, with automatic expansion of archive files

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimport_to_blender\fR [\fIoptions\fR ...] \fIinput_file\fR \fIoutput_blend_file\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B import_to_blender
is a command-line tool which, given an input file, will launch Blender
in batch mode and invoke one of its available importer addons to convert
the file to
.B .blend
format. The extension on
.I input_file
will be used to find a recognized importer, or it can be one of
the common archive formats, in which case it will be extracted
to a temporary directory and its contents used to find an importer.

Any external image textures that are referenced (for example,
included in the archive file) will be packed into the
.B .blend
file, making it self-contained. Their associated file paths will
be set to something reasonable, allowing them to be conveniently
extracted if needed.

.I output_blend_file
can also be a directory name, in which case the output
.B .blend
file will be created within it, with the same base name as
.IR input_file .

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--arg=\fIkeyword\fB=\fIvalue\fR
specifies an additional keyword argument for the import operator.
May be specified multiple times with different keywords.

.TP
\fB--blender=\fIblender\fR
specifies the path to the Blender executable. Defaults to
searching for the name “blender” in your \fBPATH\fR.

.TP
.B --consider-all
consider all available importers, whether enabled as standard
or not. Otherwise, preference is given to standard importers,
with ones needing explicit enabling only considered if none
of the standard ones can handle the file.

.TP
\fB--existing=error\fR|\fBmerge\fR|\fBoverwrite\fR
specifies what to do if the output .blend file already exists:
.RS
.TP
.B error
-- signal an error and abort the conversion (default)

.TP
.B merge
-- merge the imported model into the existing
.B .blend
file

.TP
.B overwrite
-- overwrite the output
.B .blend
file
.RE

.TP
.B --merge-multi
specifies that, if multiple importable files are found in
an archive, then they are all to be imported into a single
.B .blend
file, with a separate collection created for each
one. Otherwise, if multiple importable files are found,
this is an error. In any case, the files must all have the
same extension, so they can be handled by the same
importer.

.TP
.B --quiet
Reduce messages displayed.

.TP
\fB--postexec=\fIscript\fR
executes the specified Python code after the import, just prior
to saving the
.B .blend
file. May be specified multiple times; the values are concatenated
in sequence, separated by newlines. May not be specified
together with
.BR --postexecfile .

.TP
\fB--postexecfile=\fIscriptfilename\fR
executes the contents of the specified text file as Python code
after the import, just prior to saving the .blend file.
May not be specified together with
.BR --postexec .

.TP
\fB--preexec=\fIscript\fR
executes the specified Python code prior to the import.
May be specified multiple times; the values are concatenated
in sequence, separated by newlines. May not be specified
together with
.BR --preexecfile .

.TP
\fB--preexecfile=\fIscriptfilename\fR
executes the contents of the specified text file as Python code
prior to the import. May not be specified together with
.BR --preexec .

.TP
\fB--scale=\fIscalefactor\fR
specifies an optional factor by which to scale the imported
model.

.TP
\fB--template=\fItemplate-name\fR
specifies the startup template to load before doing the import.

.TP
.B --test
indicates just to test the input file for importability,
without doing the actual import. Returns a status of 0 if it
looks importable, 1 if not, or 2 if multiple importable files
were found but
.B --merge-multi
was not specified.

.SH RECOGNIZED IMPORTERS

.B import_to_blender
recognizes the standard Blender importers for Alembic
.RB ( .abc ),
Collada
.RB ( .dae ),
FBX, glTF
.RB ( .gltf / .glb ),
PLY and X3D file formats. It will also import 3DS, LWO
(LightWave objects) and XPS (“XNALara”) formats, provided it
can find the requisite importer addons.

.B import_to_blender
can even handle an archive file that already contains a native
.B .blend
file, extracting that and packing in its dependencies from the archive.

.SH BUGS

Could do with better handling of the situation where more than one
importable format is discovered in the input archive.

.SH EXAMPLES

.RS 4
\fBimport_to_blender model.obj .\fR
.RE

Imports
.B model.obj
as an OBJ-format model, creating the file
.B model.blend
in the current directory.

.RS 4
\fBimport_to_blender archive.zip converted.blend\fR
.RE

Extracts
.B archive.zip
to a temporary directory, and invokes an appropriate importer
on the contents, saving the result as the file
.BR converted.blend .

.SH EXTERNAL PROGRAMS NEEDED

.B import_to_blender
relies on
.BR unar (1)
to extract archive formats.
